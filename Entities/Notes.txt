The faded note reads:<br>I can't believe how many turrets are in this place<br>What were they doing here?
The letter reads:<br>Mind your health! Eat canned food and water to survive
The faded paper reads:<br>To the north you shall find the corridors that lead you to new paths
The letter reads:<br>Avoid those turrets at all cost!
I OWE YOU: ONE LEVEL.
I OWE YOU: ONE LEVEL.
